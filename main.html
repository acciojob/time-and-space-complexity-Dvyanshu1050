	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  
    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to analyze how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. 
        It helps us understand how efficient a program or algorithm is when processing data. 
        Developers aim to write code with better Time complexity to make it more efficient.
    </p>


    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs as the input grows. 
        It helps determine how much extra space is required to store variables, data structures, and recursion stack. 
        For example, an algorithm that needs memory proportional to the input size may have a space complexity of O(n).
